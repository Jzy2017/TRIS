## Note
  * For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.
  * You can train and test the model using the following commands, or choose the pre-trained checkpoint that we provide.
  * For using custom data and pre-trained models, you need to replace the paths in the code with your own local paths.

## ImageAlignment
- First, you need to train a image alignment model:
```bash
cd ImageAlignment
python train.py
```
- To test a trained alignment network:

```Shell
python test.py
```

## ImageReconstruction
- Second, you need to train a image reconstruction model:
```bash
cd ../ImageReconstruction
python train.py
```
- To test a trained reconstruction network:

```Shell
python test.py
```
Then you can get the final robust stitching results.
